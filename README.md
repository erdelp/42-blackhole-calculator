## üí° About the Project
The **42 Blackhole Calculator** helps students of the [42 Network Campuses](https://42.fr/) track their progress and predict when they might enter the "blackhole" phase.

The blackhole is a part of the 42 curriculum that requires students to maintain activity to avoid removal from the program. This tool calculates your estimated days left.

The project was originally done using simple JS, HTML and CSS, it was also the occasion for me to try Github Copilot and Claude 3.5 Sonnet Integration.

It was then manually migrated to a Next.js app with simple API Calls to 42 API using OAuth2 for user data reading.

## üåü DISCLAIMER
The project was created using publicly available information about the Pace System and Pace 24 Deadlines. Please note that this information is subject to change; therefore, the results may be inaccurate.

**Use this as an indication but not as the absolute truth**

The freeze day calculation is not guaranteed to be working accurately because of unretrievable data from 42API but will give you a gross idea of when your blackhole is.
Again, **Use this as an indication but not as the absolute truth** .
