## üí° About the Project
The **42 Blackhole Calculator** helps students of the [42 Paris](https://42.fr/) track their progress and predict when they might enter the "blackhole" phase.

The blackhole is a part of the 42 curriculum that requires students to maintain activity to avoid removal from the program. This tool calculates your estimated days left.

The project was done using simple JS, HTML and CSS, it was also the occasion for me to try Github Copilot and Claude 3.5 Sonnet Integration, it's scary and impressive what it helped me to do, considering this is my first web project.
