## üí° About the Project
The **42 Blackhole Calculator** helps students of the [42 Paris](https://42.fr/) track their progress and predict when they might enter the "blackhole" phase. 

The blackhole is a part of the 42 curriculum that requires students to maintain activity to avoid removal from the program. This tool calculates your estimated days left.
